| [All Scrapping process.ipynb](https://github.com/ansonnn07/Anime-Recommendation/blob/main/web/All%20Scrapping%20process.ipynb) | This notebook came from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Hernan4444/MyAnimeList-Database) which keep everything related to the data for the Kaggle dataset.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [cf_embedding.ipynb](https://github.com/ansonnn07/Anime-Recommendation/blob/main/web/cf_embedding.ipynb)                       | Notebook used for preparing the data and training the **collaborative filtering (CF) embedding model with neural networks**. This notebook is highly inspired by the amazing [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/chaitanya99/recommendation-system-cf-anime/) by [Chaitanya](https://www.kaggle.com/chaitanya99). |
| [collab_filter_rec.ipynb](https://github.com/ansonnn07/Anime-Recommendation/blob/main/web/collab_filter_rec.ipynb)             | This notebook shows the training of another **collaborative filtering model** which is not based on embeddings, but based on cosine similarity instead, and trained using an unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbor model instead of neural networks.                                                                         |
| [content_based_rec.ipynb](https://github.com/ansonnn07/Anime-Recommendation/blob/main/web/content_based_rec.ipynb)             | This notebook shows the training of **content-based recommendation model** based on cosine similarity and word-transformed vectors.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [scrape_img_synopsis.ipynb](https://github.com/ansonnn07/Anime-Recommendation/blob/main/web/scrape_img_synopsis.ipynb)         | This notebook shows the scraping process of the Anime image thumbnail URLs and more complete synopsis as the image URLs were not provided in the original dataset, and there were some words missing in the synopsis scraped in the original dataset.                                                                  |
